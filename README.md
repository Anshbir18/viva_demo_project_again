# Design




## Data Flow

Data flows through the library's functions, interacting with the various components to perform the desired operations.

## User Interface

The user interface primarily involves including the appropriate header and linking the library when compiling your C code.

# Installation and Usage

To use CUtilLib in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cutillib.git`
2. Navigate to the library directory: `cd cutillib`
3. Compile the library: `gcc -c cutil.c -o cutil.o`
4. Create the static library: `ar rcs libcutil.a cutil.o`
5. Include the library header in your C code: `#include "cutil.h"`
6. Link your program with the static library: `-L/path/to/library -lcutil`

# Examples

Here are some simple examples showcasing the use of CUtilLib:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "cutil.h"

int main() {
    // String operations
    char str[] = "radar";
    if (isPalindrome(str)) {
        printf("The string is a palindrome.\\n");
    } else {
        printf("The string is not a palindrome.\\n");
    }

    // Integer operations
    int num = 8;
    if (isPowerOf2(num)) {
        printf("%d is a power of 2.\\n", num);
    } else {
        printf("%d is not a power of 2.\\n", num);
    }

    return 0;
}
